**> log4erl:add_file_appender(Name, Spec) -> ok | {error, E}
  Name :: atom() name of the appender. This value will be used
  to uniquely references this file appender and can be used to 
  change log level and format of the appended file. This appender
  will be added to the default_logger

  Spec :: tuple() of the form
       {LogDir, LogFileName, {size, Size}, NumOfRotations, Suffix, LogLevel}
  or
       {LogDir, LogFileName, {size, Size}, NumOfRotations, Suffix, LogLevel, Format}
  This tuple defines the appender's attributes.
  If Format is not specified, the default format is "[%L] %l%n".

  Example:
  log4erl:add_file_appender(chat_room1, {"../logs", "room1", {size, 100000}, 4, "txt", warn}).
  This will directs log4erl to create a file appender and add it to the default
  logger. all log messages towards default logger will be written to file
  "../logs/room1.txt". The file will have a size limit of 100000, after which
  the file will be rotated for 4 times. The log level will be warn, which means
  info & debug messages will not be written. Format is a list of specifiers. The meanin of these 
  specifiers can be found in description of log4erl:change_format/2 below.

  After suffeciantly long time, the directory "../logs" will look like this:
  $> ls -l
  -rw-rw-r--  1 ahmed ahmed 103845 Jun 25 11:41 logger1_2.elog
  -rw-rw-r--  1 ahmed ahmed 102095 Jun 25 11:41 logger1_3.elog
  -rw-rw-r--  1 ahmed ahmed 106435 Jun 25 11:41 logger1_4.elog
  -rw-rw-r--  1 ahmed ahmed 103390 Jun 25 11:41 logger1_1.elog
  -rw-rw-r--  1 ahmed ahmed   7385 Jun 25 11:41 logger1.elog  

**> log4erl:add_file_appender(Logger, Appender, SpecFile) -> ok
  Logger :: atom()
  Appender :: atom()

  This will create a new appender and associate spec in Spec or in SpecFile to it. Spec and
  content of SpecFile are the same as in add_file_appender/2

  Example:
  log4erl:add_file_appender(chat_log, file_logger, "../priv/chat_logs.conf").
  This will add another logger with the name "chat_log" and use configuration in
  the file "../priv/chat_logs.conf" for it. To write to this log, you need to specify
  the name of the logger.

**> log4erl:add_console_appender(Appender, Spec) -> ok
    log4erl:add_console_appender(Logger, Appender, Spec) -> ok
  Logger :: atom()
  Appender :: atom()
  Spec :: tuple()

  This will create a new console appender to either Logger or default logger and associate spec in Spec to it.
  Spec is in the form {Level, Format}, which means exactly as it is in file_appender Spec

  Example:
  log4erl:add_console_appender(cmd_logs, {info, "%j %T [%L] %l%n"}).

**> log4erl:add_smtp_appender(Appender, Spec) -> ok
    log4erl:add_smtp_appender(Logger, Appender, Spec) -> ok
  Logger :: atom()
  Appender :: atom()
  Spec :: tuple() | list()

  @since version 0.8.4

  This will create a new smtp appender to either Logger of default logger and initialize it to spec in Spec or
  file named Spec if Spec is a list. Spec is in the below form. MsgFormat is the format of the body of the email
  has the same meaning as the format of Format in add_file_logger/2,3.
       {Level, Server, Auth, Msg}
	       where:
	       Level = atom()
	       Server = {Ip, Port} | {Ip} | Ip
	       Auth = {Username, Passwd} | no_auth
	       Msg = {From, To, Title, MsgFormat} | {To, Title, MsgFormat} | {To, MsgFormat}

  Example:
  log4erl:add_smpt_appender(appender1, {warn, {"smtp.domain.com"}, {"name","secret"},
				       {"My_app", "alarm@domain.com", "Alarm log", "%L - %j %T %n%l%n"}}).

  This will create an smtp_appender called appender1 with level 'warn'. The appender will connect to
  "smtp.domain.com" email server with default SMTP port (25) and authenticate using username "name" and
  password "secret". The message will have 'From' field of "My_app", will be sent to 'alarm@domain.com',
  have a title of "Alarm log" and the body of the email will be formatted according to the MsgFormat
  "%L - %j %T %n %l%n". An email sent using this appender will be as following:
  
  From: <My_app>
  To: <alarm@domain.com>
  Title: <Alarm log>
  Body:
  <warn - 01-03-2009 12:21:09,818534
  test smtp appender>

**> log4erl:add_syslog_appender(Appender, Spec) -> ok
    log4erl:add_syslog_appender(Logger, Appender, Spec) -> ok
  Logger :: atom()
  Appender :: atom()
  Spec :: tuple() | list()

  @since version 0.8.5

  This will create a new syslog appender to either Logger of default logger and initialize it to spec in Spec or
  file named Spec if Spec is a list. Spec is in the below form. MsgFormat is the format of the message and it
  has the same meaning as the format of Format in add_file_logger/2,3.

  Note: In for syslog_appender to work, you need to enable syslogd to accept network messages. In linux, you
  need to use '-r' switch when running syslogd.

  Spec =
       {Level, Fac} |
       {Level, Fac, Host} |
       {Level, Fac, Host, Format} |
       {Level, Fac, Host, Port, Format}
	       where:
	       Level = atom()
	       Fac = atom()
	       Host = string() | tuple()
	       Port = integer()
	       Format = string()

  Example:
  log4erl:add_syslog_appender(appender1, {warn, user, "syslog_srvr", "(%L) - %S %l%n"}}).

  This will create a syslog_appender called appender1 with level 'warn' and uses 'user' facility.
  The appender will connect to host "syslog_srvr" with default port (514). The messages will be
  formatted according to the format "%L - %j %T %n %l%n".

  Default host is "localhost".
  Default port is 514.
  Default Format is the same as default format of file_appender
